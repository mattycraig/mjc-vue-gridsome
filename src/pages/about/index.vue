            p Over the course of my professional career, I have obtained an extensive background in front end web development and digital design. I am extremely comfortable working with the leading web development standards of today. This includes: building mobile-first responsive cross-browser compliant websites, utilization of javascript frameworks such as AngularJS for single page web applications, and working with APIs to enhance the dynamic experience for the user. I have a great passion for usability and user experience, and the optimization and performance of websites and web applications. I have been able to touch many different frameworks, tools, technology stacks, and environments which has allowed me to become a versatile front end developer and digital designer.
