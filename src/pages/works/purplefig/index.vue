            p The Purple Fig is an online womenâ€™s blogazine with an emphasis on realistic and inspiring personal stories from women of all age groups, lifestyles, and nationalities. Having used an already established Wordpress site with a typical purchasable theme, they signed on for a completely customized design & development solution for the next iteration of their blog. We started out with a few things in mind: a mobile-first responsive design that would enable the blog to work on multiple devices and platforms and a brand that would be on target with their demographic & audience.
            p The end result was a completely customized theme tailored to their specific needs including the need for social media interaction, an area for their contributors to be known, and a unique custom authoring solution for visitors to post their own stories via their Letters section.
